- Agile vs DevOps
-------------------
Agile vs DevOps is the comparison between two software development approaches that are used in the industry presently. Agile is a standard practice of module development with incremental features delivery with SDLC phases, including requirements gathering, development, testing, debugging and maintenance. Whereas DevOps is the process of collaborating development with the operation team tasks for faster software development lifecycles. The agile approach focuses on a constant change process, whereas DevOps works based upon continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) with quality delivery. DevOps is a better approach for most of the business scenarios with time to market with large scale project implementations capabilities compared to the Agile process.

- Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment
---------------------------------------------------------
CI - Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

Continous Delivery - Continuous delivery is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually. 

Continuous Deployment - Continuous Deployment is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment. The software release cycle has evolved over time.

- Difference b/w Git & Github
--------------------------------
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
